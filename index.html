      <li>I have to communicate the goals and targets of each day whist always trying
        to push the team into exceeding them and producing the product in the most
        efficient way</li>
      <li>I have to make sure that the team and myself are maintaining high levels of
        excellence throughout each day and follow and enforce all health, safety and
        hygiene</li>
      <li>Keeping track of all the different packet labels for each order was very
        important as we would use them to back trace the product to the source using the
        batch codes</li>
      <li>During the day I have lots of different orders coming through to me at one
        time, which has helped improve my time management and problem solving skills
        along the way</li>
      <li>I've had to change our operating procedures a few times due to new machinery
        or software updates, which I quickly adapted to whilst keeping production going
        in an efficient manner</li>
      <li>Prior to being the assistant supervisor I would put forward lots of ways
        things could be done differently to help improve production</li>
      <li>Proper planning, preparation and trust in my team meant it also gave me the
        chance to help in other areas of the factory and improve my knowledge of the
        whole process of the company</li>
